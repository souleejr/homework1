Homework Assignment 1
We were given the task to clean up (refactor) a webpage that had a few minor issues, to make it accessible. The webpage should now meet accessibility standards! 
You are able to view the source code and find semantic HTML elements. The structure of the HTML elements follow a logical structure with independent style and positioning. Images were placed and accessible alt attributes were attached and can be found easily. The heading attributes fall in sequential order. The title was added to the Webpage. A favicon was added.
